## Description

The Pig-Dice game is a fun game based on two players rolling a dice.

A player rolls the die until either:

    1. A one is rolled
    2. The player chooses to hold i.e. stop rolling

When a one is rolled, accumulated points are discarded and the other player takes over the dice.

When Hold is pressed, the accumulated points are added to the player's final Score.

The other player then takes the die over.

### Specifications

The web application will request the names of two users.

The two players will proceed to roll the dice, by generating a random number from 1 to 6.

If the output is not a 1, a player will continue to accumulate points and can hold in his discretion to add up to his/her final tally.

An output of one results in a zero of accumulated points.

### The first player to get 100 is the Winner!
